    <p>
      This project was generated with <strong>Angular CLI</strong> version 9.0.4. It retrieves a Sitecore list that has
      columns defined that will map directly to columns from an API call response object. There are 2 angular packages
      that make up part of the application and they are the header and table packages. These packages reside in the
      projects directory of the root.
    </p>

    <h3>header component</h3>

    <p>Pass a description to display. Field name is "header".</p>

    <h3>table component</h3>

    <p>Table has 3 variable that need to be passed in.</p>

    <h4>data</h4>

    <p><strong>data</strong> is the response object from the API call.</p>

    <h4>allColumnNames</h4>

    <p>
      <strong>allColumnNames</strong> these are just the names that are defined in Sitecore list. The Sitecore list of
      columns should be all columns that can potentially be displayed from the API response object.
    </p>

    <h4>selectedColumns</h4>

    <p>
      <strong>selectedColumns</strong> are the columns that will be displayed in the table view. The selectedColumns
      must have properties of: name, label, type. Valid types are: boolean, currency, date, decimal, number, & percent.
      The selectedColumns are all the columns that are marked as selected in the Sitecore list.
    </p>

    <h3>Pre-Build Steps</h3>

    <p>
      1) You must remove the library build files (header, table) from the package.json in the root and then run
      <strong>npm i -f</strong>. (Save this in the clip board it is needed in step 3)
    </p>
    <p>
      2) Run <strong>npm run all</strong>. This step will build the libraries that are needed to build the base
      application.
    </p>
    <p>
      3) Restore the libaries saved in the clip board to the package.json file in the root and then run
      <strong>npm i -f</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      4) The application should be built. You can now run <strong>npm start</strong> or <strong>npm run build</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>Development server</h2>

    <p>
      Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you
      change any of the source files.
    </p>

    <h2>Build</h2>

    <p>
      Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod`
      flag for a production build.
    </p>
