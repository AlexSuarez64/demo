      This project was generated with <strong>Angular CLI</strong> version 9.0.4. It retrieves a Sitecore list that has
      columns defined that will map directly to columns from an API call response object. There are 2 angular packages
      that make up part of the application and they are the header and table packages. These packages reside in the
      projects directory of the root.
